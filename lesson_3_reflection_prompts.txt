When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- I would want a remote repository for when I have to add code from another computer for example. This remote repository would also be useful when different people are working together, they can add files from their local computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- This allows better control on when to pull changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are a way to clone a repository you do not have permission to change. Clones are a way to clone a directory locally so then you can make changes
to them. Branches are the best way to try new features or new ideas without actually breaking the code that is present on the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

- There is a benefit in this because by having the last known state of the remote stored locally, you have that commit in common where both the remote
and the local are up-to-date, any changes made from that moment on can be merged later.
