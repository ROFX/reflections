What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- Git starts to keep track of what happens on the depository, although once created there are no commits made automatically.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area allows you to prepare the files for the next commit. The staging area is different because it is a way
to work with files without them being on the working directory of the repository.
